mobile-dialplate
================

The purpose of this project is to put an old mobile phone
in an even older dialplate phone.

This is achieved by reading the dialplates pulses with an attiny2313
and "pressing" the appropriate keys on the mobile phone by closing
the contacts using bilateral switches and analog multi/demultiplexers.
